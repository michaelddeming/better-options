    - Set up git repo and added some basic starting files.
    - Linked to GitHub for tracking online.
    - Dev Thoughts:
        - I want Better-Options to be a multi-tool/asset package for scanning stock options for potential value. 
        - I do not current have a strict plan regarding what I deem "value" to be other than touch/feel of a option/contract. Current indicators include TA/Vol.
        - Need more research on option fundamentals (greeks, etc.)
        - Intened to used YFinance at first to get options data, may expand to more real-time services in the future.
